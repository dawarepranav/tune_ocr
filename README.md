# OCR Model Using GOT OCR 2.0

One of the most impressive aspects of **GOT-OCR2.0** is its ability to tackle diverse Optical Character Recognition (OCR) challenges. From deciphering text in natural scenes like street signs and billboards to processing multi-page documents with intricate layouts, this AI model handles everything with precision. Originally trained for **English** and **Chinese**, this model has been **fine-tuned for Hindi** as well, expanding its versatility.

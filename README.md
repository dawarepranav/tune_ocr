# OCR Model Using GOT OCR 2.0

One of the most impressive aspects of **GOT-OCR2.0** is its ability to tackle diverse Optical Character Recognition (OCR) challenges. From deciphering text in natural scenes like street signs and billboards to processing multi-page documents with intricate layouts, this AI model handles everything with precision. Originally trained for **English** and **Chinese**, this model has been **fine-tuned for Hindi** as well, expanding its versatility.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Follow these steps to use the fine-tuned model in your project:

Load the model and tokenizer:
```python

from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Path to your fine-tuned model
model_path = 'pranavdaware/web_ocr'

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, device_map='cuda', use_safetensors=True)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model = model.eval().cuda()
```
